            <p>BROTHERHOOD: The year is 872, and many of the separate kingdoms of what we now know as Brotherhood Land have fallen to the invading Brits, leaving the great kingdom of Unityland standing alone and defiant under the command of baldman Azaz Khaku. Against this turbulent backdrop lives our hero. Born the son of a Indian nobleman, he is captured by the Brits and raised as one of their own. Forced to choose between the country of his birth and the people of his upbringing, his loyalties are ever tested. What is he? Indian or Brit? On a quest to reclaim his birthright, He must tread a dangerous path between both sides if he is to play his part in the birth of a new nation and, ultimately, recapture his ancestral lands.</p>
